# TD Hospital Exploration

### Introduction
Given the ubiquity of automated decision-making systems in our lives, a good understanding of the inner workings of different models is important. 
Modern AI and machine learning algorithms are especially difficult with respect to explaining their outcomes. 
Explaining the "black box" problem inherent in these models will provide people with more confidence in their use.

### Description
The TD Hospital has come to you regarding a problem with their patient data. Over the many years of its operation, the hospital data accrued flaws, 
but no one working there now knows exactly what those flaws are. They want your help to fix it and understand what information is contained.

- You are given a dataset for a specific group of patients which has patient data and whether or not the patient survived.
- You want to use this dataset to understand what contributes to survival.
- The dataset has inherent flaws that you may want to change or remove.
- You are also provided with example code that takes in the data and trains a model.
- You can use this code for a baseline submission to get up and running.

### Predictions
What type of model did you choose to use if you decided to use a model outside of the starter code.(Random forests, SVM, Regression, Other types of Neural Networks)
And if you did choose to use another one or change the starter code why did you choose to do so.
The objective is to interpret the data and communicate your understandings in an effective manner.

### Data
Your dataset is given to you in the form of a csv file, the first row will have the titles of the columns, 
and each subsequent row will contain information for a patient with one row representing one patient. 
You are also provided a document explaining what data the hospital has collected. Be careful about the information given, 
carefully decide whether and how it should be used. Make sure to do your research!
